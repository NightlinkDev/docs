Crypto Dark Pool

What is the problem: 
When selling or buying large amounts of crypto currencies you will affect the price of the asset. Trying to execute a large order takes time and means you have to accept a discounted price below market value due to slippage. There is also the problem of liquidity, if there is not a counterparty willing to sell/buy your asset. Trading through public markets discloses your position as well as exposing you to transaction fees. 
Devaluation is becoming an increasingly larger problem as electronic trading platforms allow prices to respond quicker. It is also becoming harder to trade blocks through individual exchanges meaning you have to try and spread the orders across multiple exchanges which allows other traders to get in front and accumulate the inventory pushing prices up. This is intensified by high frequency trading which public markets are exposed to. 

Product/ Solution:
We aim to allow individual investors the opportunity to provide the liquidity in order to allow block trading of crypto currencies. We will provide a dark pool which matches up individuals assets in order to execute block trades. We provide individual investors the opportunity to loan funds into the pool for an agreed upon period of time and premium value for the funds if it is used to execute a trade. Their funds will be reserved and accumulated into our darkpool, where if it is used we return the value of their funds plus a premium. By reserving funds for an agreed cost and time period it allows us to build up a liquidity pool. Which we can then match up with other smaller funds to fulfill a block order. We will offer a discounted price for the block trades which will reflect the advantage of avoiding slippage and the liquidity provided by individual investors. Our revenue will be generated by arbitraging the two different prices for individual funds and block orders. For the individual investor they will either be returned their funds if they have not been used during the agreed time period or they will be returned a premium for the use of their assets. For the block traders they avoid the slippage and transaction fees of trading through a public exchange. We take the difference between the discounted price of the block traders and the premiums agreed with the individuals.
