Project Name: 
Night Link 

Describe project in a sentence: 
Crypto Dark Pool

What is the problem: 
When trading large amounts of cryptocurrency, the price of the asset is negatively impacted due to the time and slippage it takes to execute such orders. Liquidity is also an issue if there is no willing counterparty to buy/sell the asset. Trading in public markets can further compound these issues, as it exposes your position and incurs transaction fees. Electronic trading platforms are exacerbating the problem, as prices can respond more quickly than ever before. In addition, trading blocks of cryptocurrency on individual exchanges has become more challenging, as it may involve spreading orders across multiple exchanges, which can expose traders to higher prices due to inventory accumulation by other traders. This is intensified by high frequency trading which public markets are exposed to. 

Product/ Solution:
We aim to allow individual investors the opportunity to provide the liquidity in order to allow block trading of crypto currencies. We will provide a dark pool which matches up individuals assets in order to execute block trades. We provide individual investors the opportunity to loan funds into the pool for an agreed upon period of time and premium value for the funds if it is used to execute a trade. Their funds will be reserved and accumulated into our darkpool, where if it is used we return the value of their funds plus a premium. By reserving funds for an agreed cost and time period it allows us to build up a liquidity pool. Which we can then match up with other smaller funds to fulfill a block order. We will offer a discounted price for the block trades which will reflect the advantage of avoiding slippage and the liquidity provided by individual investors. Our revenue will be generated by arbitraging the two different prices for individual funds and block orders. For the individual investor they will either be returned their funds if they have not been used during the agreed time period or they will be returned a premium for the use of their assets. For the block traders they avoid the slippage and transaction fees of trading through a public exchange. We take the difference between the discounted price of the block traders and the premiums agreed with the individuals.

Market Size/ Growth: 
The average volume traded on the FTSE100 is around 875 million, this is 33 times smaller than that of BTC-USD which averages 29 billion. The average total weekly amount of trades made through dark pools are 33 million for equities based on FINRAâ€™s ATS data. This means there could be an estimated 1 billion trades per week in BTC-USD alone. SFOX provides decentralised dark pools and are estimated to have increased their employee count by 30% last year. This speaks to the size and growth of this space. 

Why now? How ready is the market?
Blockchain technology is being adopted by more businesses and individuals. This is driving market growth. As this market becomes more mainstream, demand for advanced trading solutions will rise. There is a need for more efficient and secure methods of executing block trades. In addition we have seen dark pools similar to that of equity dark pools emergining in the market.
