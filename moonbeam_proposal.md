Describe project in a sentence: 
Crypto Dark Pool

What is the problem: 
When selling or buying large amounts of crypto currencies you will affect the price of the asset. Trying to execute a large order takes time and means you have to accept a discounted price below market value due to slippage. There is also the problem of liquidity, if there is not a counterparty willing to sell/buy your asset. Trading through public markets discloses your position as well as exposing you to transaction fees. 
Devaluation is becoming an increasingly larger problem as electronic trading platforms allow prices to respond quicker. It is also becoming harder to trade blocks through individual exchanges meaning you have to try and spread the orders across multiple exchanges which allows other traders to get in front and accumulate the inventory pushing prices up. This is intensified by high frequency trading which public markets are exposed to. 

Product/ Solution:
We aim to allow individual investors the opportunity to provide the liquidity in order to allow block trading of crypto currencies. We will provide a dark pool which matches up individuals assets in order to execute block trades. We provide individual investors the opportunity to loan funds into the pool for an agreed upon period of time and premium value for the funds if it is used to execute a trade. Their funds will be reserved and accumulated into our darkpool, where if it is used we return the value of their funds plus a premium. By reserving funds for an agreed cost and time period it allows us to build up a liquidity pool. Which we can then match up with other smaller funds to fulfill a block order. We will offer a discounted price for the block trades which will reflect the advantage of avoiding slippage and the liquidity provided by individual investors. Our revenue will be generated by arbitraging the two different prices for individual funds and block orders. For the individual investor they will either be returned their funds if they have not been used during the agreed time period or they will be returned a premium for the use of their assets. For the block traders they avoid the slippage and transaction fees of trading through a public exchange. We take the difference between the discounted price of the block traders and the premiums agreed with the individuals. 


What infrastructure are you building on?
We plan to build using 3 core technologies:
1: Substrate
Used build the parachain that is the core of the protocol.

2: Phala's PhatContract.
We need a way of matching orders privately and securely to en, a platform that can constantly calculate accurate discounts/premiums. PhatContract will allow us to do this while storing api keys securely so they can interact.

3: Moonbeams
We will use moonbeam do deploy a contract that allows for a quick and efficient on and off ramp for ethereum holders.


Do you have any token plans?
Yes, we have thought about tokenisation as a way to enhance our business model. Our approach involves using dot/ksm tokens to cover transaction fees, which allows us to use the tokens to represent a profit share in the network. This will create a more aligned and incentivised ecosystem where all participants have a stake in the success of the network.

Furthermore, we have plans to mint and sell a percentage of the tokens every month/year through an auction system. The proceeds from the token sales will be used to improve liquidity on the network, while also ensuring that the distribution of tokens is fair and transparent.
Holders of the tokens will have voting rights to determine the level of risk and different strategies to be implemented, as well as receiving a percentage of the profits generated by the the trading strategy.
This is still very much an idea and we are looking forward to feedback and discussions on topics like staking and allocation.

Market Size/ Growth: 
The average volume traded on the FTSE100 is around 875 million, this is 33 times smaller than that of BTC-USD which averages 29 billion. The average total weekly amount of trades made through dark pools are 33 million for equities based on FINRAâ€™s ATS data. This means there could be an estimated 1 billion trades per week in BTC-USD alone.
